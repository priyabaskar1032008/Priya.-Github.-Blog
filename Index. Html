Hello everyone,
My name is Shanmugapriya, and I am currently studying first year at SRM Valliammai Engineering College. I consider myself a friendly and good-hearted person, and I am naturally talkative, which helps me connect easily with others. I enjoy communicating with people, making new friends, and learning new things from every conversation. I am excited to grow both academically and personally during my time in college.

Thank you!
